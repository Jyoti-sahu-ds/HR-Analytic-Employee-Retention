# Business Problem
One of the most prevalent problems in any organization is attrition. The time, money, and effort required to train new hires can result in significant losses for the business. Onboarding, advertising, hiring, training, and lost productivity are all included in the loss cost. Attrition also breeds mistrust or uncertainty among current workers toward management. This project intends to construct a predictive model, offer retention advice, and give in-depth study of the factors that affect employee turnover.
